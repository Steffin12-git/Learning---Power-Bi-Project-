# Learning---Power-Bi-Project-
As part of my Power BI learning journey, this project covers data cleaning, modeling, DAX calculations, and visualization. Using Power Query, data is cleaned, and relationships are established. DAX enables deeper analysis, while interactive dashboards enhance insights. This hands-on experience strengthens my Power BI skills.
